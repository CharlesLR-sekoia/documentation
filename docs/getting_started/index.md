# Welcome to SEKOIA.IO

**SEKOIA.IO** is a **Cybersecurity Platform as a Service**, based on our ability to leverage threat intelligence to dynamically integrate it into an innovative approach of the cyberdefense.

A SIEM application can trigger alerts from the security events received,  based on three principles:

- CTI rules based on dedicated CTI indicator feeds generated by SEKOIA.
- Correlation rules between events.
- Threshold rules.

If confirmed by **SOC team**, the alert becomes an incident in an **incident application** made for **CERT teams**.

SEKOIA also offers Managed services for incident Detection and Response (MDR) based on the SEKOIA.IO platform.

In addition to a web interface, SEKOIA.IO provides **REST/API** for external apps for almost all of its features.

**In order to test SEKOIA.IO, you just have to create an account and send your logs to the platform.**
