# Threat Exposition

When connecting to SEKOIA.IO, you will first access to the main dashboard "Threat Exposition". 

With this dashboard, you can visualize your risk exposition level easily:

- Current global risk level
- Number of new raised alerts during the selected period
- Number of events ingested by SEKOIA.IO during the selected period

These key numbers are also detailed by entities in the lower part of the screen and you can manage easily the time range you want to display.
