- Latests comments added to alerts or cases
- Most urgent active alerts during the selected period

Several of these widgets allow quick access to the relevant elements in the Operation Center.

You can manage easily the time range you want to display and the refresh period of your dashboard in the top right of the screen.

## Create a new dashboard

The Default Dashboard offered by SEKOIA cannot be modified.

In addition to this, you have the possibility of creating your own dashboard, in order to match it as best as possible to your uses.

Several widgets are available to you, with the possibility depending on the chosen widget to configure various filters.
